**Dear group members of AMI 2023,**

this is your test folder where you can add your unittests to protect your code.

 - Your unittest file should start with `test_*.py`. For example there is already a file -  `test_dummy.py`
 - You can run the tests locally from the top folder by running: `python -m unittest discover -s ./app`. This will run all the tests from all the test files.


Best regards and have fun!
